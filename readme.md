charging with right click allows you to move over non-inked surfaces really fast, but beware that you must charge it for atleast .45 seconds!

Squid rolls can be performed by pressing space while having atleast 50% speed and having your mouse atleast 80 degrees different than your current heading. This allows for instant turning at the cost of 15% speed, also lets you jump over uninked surfaces!
